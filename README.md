## Overview

This is an automation framwork for testing the SauceDemo e commerce site. The programming language used is C# using NUnit framework with Selenium as the UI automaton driver. A node server is executed in order to hit an API endpoint to access test data. Extent reports is consumed for reporting. These test scripts are kicked off when a branch is merged into master. 

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- **`LoginPage.cs`**  
  Encapsulates all locators and actions for the login screen.

- **`ProductPage.cs`**  
  Validates post-login behavior, product title, cart count, item sort by price and description (asending and desending)

## ðŸ”§ Base Driver Class

- `BaseDriver.cs` handles WebDriver initialization.
- Currently supports **ChromeDriver**.
- Easily extendable to include FirefoxDriver, Edge, etc.

## ðŸ§° Utils

- `ReturnTestData.cs` contains logic to fetch login credentials from a local API.
- JSON file (`loginData.json`) is served via a lightweight API and deserialized in the framework.

## ðŸ§ª Running the Tests

### â–¶ Locally - run the server in order to access the test data via the test scripts

1. Open cmd prompt where the server is located
2. type in `node server.js`
3. keep server running in order for the test scripts to access the json test data

### â–¶ From Visual Studio:

1. Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Set the test project as Startup
3. Build the solution
4. Run tests via **Test Explorer**

### â–¶ From CLI:

```bash
dotnet test
